## Why study Creative Computing?

This was my first experience with Creative Computing. When I do something for the first time I always like to ask myself why I am doing it.

Such deceptively simple questions are often the most important. This allowed me to complete an idea-driven project. So why study Creative Computing?
In my opinion, Computing is the basis of many art forms, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, generative art, installation art and so on. It builds a bridge between man and machine, or it builds a virtual world for people.This allows the computer to respond to a person's behaviour or consciousness on a pre-programmed basis through different electronic components. This can usually magnify a certain behavior of people or an artist's intention, so that the audience can better reflect on it.

## Research

###### 928 faux fur pom poms, 464 motors, control electronics, xbox kinect motion sensor, mac-mini computer, custom software, wooden armature

This is a very typical human-computer interaction system, which records people's actions and behaviors and then feeds back to the audience. This work makes use of motion sensors, motors, control electronic devices, etc., and obtains a work worth thinking through a series of programming.

This is an AR work. The audience can interact with the painting through the APP of mobile phone or the screen on site. This kind of work breaks through the limitation of space and time to some extent. Express the artist's ideas in a narrative way. Therefore, the audience can experience the meaning of the work. Through virtual and real interaction, the viewer can get rid of the 2D spatial limitations of the painting.

## Some idea

1. I want to use programming and sensors to express some people's emotions. People's emotions tend to be emotional, while programs and codes tend to be rational.
2. I want to try to record life through programs. People often do not want to share their lives with others because of shyness.
3. I want to try using AR to create everything on my desktop.

# Learning process
## FIRST

Unfortunately, I had to study this unit at home, so I learned the basic circuits through the courses on Tinkercad.com.

I completed the circuit step by step according to the steps of the course. This was the first time I came into contact with Ardunio. I used an Arduino board, a breadboard, a resistor, a button, an LED, etc., and some wires. This is a relatively complex process, but it is relatively easy to complete as long as you do it step by step. Then I tried adding multiple switches or leds to the circuit. On the whole, it was a success.

After that, I started trying to write some simple code, like making my two leds blink alternately.

## TRY NEW THINGS

I need a real text or image output module to implement my idea, this can be an 8 x 8 LED dot matrix or LCD display. So I decided to study the LCD display on Tinkercad.com so it could display my name and a sentence.

I consulted some of my classmates studying IT in China and looked up some relevant tutorials on C++ programming language. I tried to connect the circuit board and had the LCD display display my name on the first line and a sentence in the middle of the second line.

Of course, the process was not very smooth. I had a lot of problems. For example, the LCD screen burns due to excessive current, and the code fails to work due to errors. Fortunately, I solved them one by one and finally completed a circuit system that can display my name.

## TRY MORE

I'd like to try out some new output components, such as a 7-segment display. This is a display that can display individual numbers and partial letters. I can use it for more subtle manipulation, like how to display each character. This requires more detailed procedures and more complex wiring

Under the remote guidance of my Chinese classmate Meidong Pei, I went back to connect the circuit and write the program. Each independent display unit of the 7-segment display can turn on and off in turn.

# Reflection
This is a project well worth trying. This was my first experience with programming, and overall it went well. Through this week's study
I learned how to complete the circuit, how to connect the output components correctly to the circuit, how to complete and implement simple programming. This is very helpful for later study. With this knowledge, I can design interactive devices. Or use programming to complete the construction of virtual worlds. This can break down the limitations of space and time.

However, learning online is not enough, I still need to continue to practice my ideas in the studio. The actual operation of the circuits and programming is not as easy as it might seem, but it is not boring. This requires me to be very careful and dedicated to finish my work. I enjoy this process very much. Only when I experience a technology in an immersive way can I get more wonderful. Of course, this process was not plain sailing, AND I still encountered many difficulties. For example, writing code is very error-prone, and I often make code errors because I am not careful enough. Therefore, I need to complete each task more carefully in the later learning process.

Anyway, I'm going to try to do more complex things with Ardunio, like controlling mechanical linkage structures. I will continue to improve my idea, which requires me to learn from many aspects.
